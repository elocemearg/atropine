    <h1>Display Setup</h1>
    <p>
    The <em>Display Setup</em> link in the sidebar takes you the page
    which administers the public-facing screen. Click the <em>Open
    Display Window</em> link at the top of this page to open the
    public-facing screen in a new browser window. You can then drag this
    new browser window onto a second screen, such as a projector or external
    monitor facing the players. Full-screen or resize this new browser window
    as necessary.
    </p>
    <h2>View selection - if in doubt, leave it on Auto</h2>
    <p>
    The menu on the Display Setup page shows you all the views you can
    choose from. If you want the least-effort solution, leave it on the
    default setting, "Auto".
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want the public-facing window to show a particular screen, you can
    select it from the list of screen modes and click "Switch to this screen
    mode". The public-facing window will then show only that screen until you
    specify otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>Default screen shape: Widescreen (16:9)</h3>
    <p>
    If you don't specify otherwise, Atropine assumes your public-facing display
    is on a Widescreen (16:9) device. Screen modes which show two different
    things at once will split the screen vertically. You can change this in
    Display Setup.
    </p>
    <p>
    In <em>Auto</em> mode, Atropine uses the following rules to decide which screen to show:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If no players are entered yet, we display the <em>Welcome</em> screen</li>
        <li>If there are players but no fixtures have been generated yet, we
            display the <em>Player Check-In</em> screen.</li>
        <li>If the latest round has had fixtures generated but no scores have been filled in yet, we display the <em>Fixtures</em> screen.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, we display the <em>Standings / Results (Vertical)</em> screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    You can optionally have Auto mode show the Videprinter instead of the
    Results table when a round is in progress but not completed yet. The
    relevant checkbox can be found on the Display Setup page under the Auto
    screen mode.
    </p>

    <h3>Screen shape: Old (4:3)</h3>
    <p>
    If your public-facing display is an old-style 4:3 device, set the screen
    shape profile to <em>Old (4:3)</em> in Display Setup. Screen modes which
    display two things at once will split the screen horizontally.
    </p>

    <p>
    In <em>Auto</em> mode in the 4:3 screen shape profile, Atropine uses the
    same rules as for Widescreen above, except that instead of the
    vertical Standings/Results screen we show the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the latest round has had some but not all of its scores filled
            in, we display the <em>Standings / Videprinter</em> screen.</li>
        <li>If the latest round has had all of its scores filled in, we display
            the <em>Standings / Table Results</em> screen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other modes</h3>
    <p>
    <em>Auto</em> mode never shows other screens such as the
    <em>High Scores</em> or <em>Overachievers</em> screens,
    so if you want to show those you need to switch to them manually using
    the Display Setup menu.
