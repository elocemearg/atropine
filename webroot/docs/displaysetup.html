    <h1>Display Setup</h1>
    <p>
    The <em>Display Setup</em> link in the sidebar takes you the page
    which administers the public-facing screen. Click the <em>Open
    Display Window</em> link at the top of this page to open the
    public-facing screen in a new browser window. You can then drag this
    new browser window onto a second screen (e.g. a projector) and full-screen
    or resize it as necessary.
    </p>
    <h2>View selection - if in doubt, leave it on Auto</h2>
    <p>
    The menu on the Display Setup page shows you all the views you can
    choose from. If you want the least-effort solution, leave it on the
    default setting, "Auto".
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want the public-facing window to show a particular screen, you can
    select it from the list of screen modes and click "Switch to this screen
    mode". The public-facing window will then show only that screen until you
    specify otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
    In <em>Auto</em> mode, Atropine uses the following rules to
    decide which screen to show:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the latest round has had fixtures generated
        but no scores have been filled in yet, we display the
        <em>Fixtures</em> screen.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, if the latest round has had some but not all of
        its scores filled in, we display the
        <em>Standings / Videprinter</em> screen.</li>
        <li>If in the latest round all games have had their
        scores filled in, we display the
        <em>Standings / Table Results</em> screen.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <em>Auto</em> mode never shows other screens such as the
    <em>High Scores</em> or <em>Overachievers</em> screens,
    so if you want to show those you need to switch to them manually using
    the Display Setup menu.
