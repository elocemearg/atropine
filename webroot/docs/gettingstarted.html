        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
    There is only one thing you need to have installed that you might not have
    already, and that is
    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>.
    Python is the programming language in which Atropine is written.
    </p>
    <p>
    To use Atropine, you either need the Windows executable, or you need
    <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python 3</a>
    installed. If you don't have it already installed, go and download and
    install it.
    At the time of writing (December 2024), the latest version of Python 3 is
    3.13.1.
    If there's a newer version by the time you read this, then install that.
    </p>
    <p>
    Python 2 is no longer supported, either by Atropine or by much else.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation (Windows executable)</h2>
    <p>
    Download the zip file which contains the Windows executable, unzip its
    contents to a folder of your choice, and run <tt>atropine.exe</tt> in
    that folder. This type of installation doesn't require Python, but it
    obviously only works on Windows.
    </p>
    <h2>Installation (Python source)</h2>
    <p>
    After you have installed Python 3 as above, download Atropine. This is
    distributed as a zip file named <tt>atropine-X.Y.Z.zip</tt>, where
    <tt>X.Y.Z</tt> is a version number. Extract this zip file into folder of
    your choosing. There are a number of files and folders, but the only one
    you need to know about to use Atropine is <tt>atropine.py</tt>.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting Atropine</h2>
    <p>
    Atropine is a web server. When you run it, you leave it sitting in the
    background and then use your web browser to connect to it and
    administer tournaments. To start atropine, run <tt>atropine.py</tt>
    or <tt>atropine.exe</tt>, depending on which flavour of installation you
    have.
    The Windows Firewall might tell you it has blocked some features of Python
    and ask you what you want to do about it. You need to allow Python to use
    at least private networks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once <tt>atropine.py</tt> or <tt>atropine.exe</tt> is running, use your web
    browser to visit <a href="http://localhost:3960/">http://localhost:3960</a>.
    This will redirect you to the home screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Next step</h2>
    <p>
    Once you've got Atropine running, you can <a href="tourneysetup.html">set
        up your first tourney</a>.
