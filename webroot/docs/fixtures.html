    <h1>Generating Fixtures</h1>
    <p>
    So now you've created your tourney, and the tourney has the list of players
    in it. To save them standing around getting bored, let's generate some
    fixtures.
    </p>

    <h2>The Generate Fixtures interface</h2>
    <p>
    This tutorial will assume a COLIN-style
    tournament structure: there are three rounds, in each round
    players are divided into groups of three, and in each group three
    games are played, with each player playing two games and hosting one.
    The fixture generator can generate fixtures in many other ways, but for
    this tutorial we'll focus on the most common format.
    </p>
    <p>
    To generate a new round, click the <em>Generate fixtures...</em> link in
    the sidebar.  You'll be presented with a list of fixture generators. Click
    <em>Random Pairings/Groups</em> (for the first round) or
    <em>Swiss Army Blunderbuss</em> (for later rounds) and
    answer the questions, telling it you want three players per table.
    For the first round, this will come back to you with a list of fixtures
    immediately; for later rounds it may take up to thirty seconds, depending
    on how many players you have.
    </p>
    <p>
    Review the fixtures, then click <em>Accept Fixtures</em>. The
    fixtures aren't committed until you click this button.
    </p>
    <p>
    You should then see a page telling you the fixtures were added
    successfully. Click the <em>Go to result entry page</em> link, or
    click the <em>Results entry</em> link in the sidebar, which goes to the
    same place.
    </p>

    <h2>Next step</h2>
    <p>
    Now you've generated fixtures, it's time to
    <a href="resultentry.html">enter the results</a>.
