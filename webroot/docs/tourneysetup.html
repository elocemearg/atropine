    <h1>Tourney Setup</h1>
    <p>
    This page shows you how to create a simple tourney and define the player
    list. It also discusses accessibility requirements for specific table
    numbers.
    </p>
    <h2>Creating a tourney</h2>
    <p>
    Decide on a name for your tourney and enter it into the "Tourney name"
    box. This name is used as the filename for the tourney's database file, 
    and it may only contain letters, numbers, underscores and hyphens - no
    spaces. So <tt>cotrodmore2020</tt> is okay, but
    <tt>Countdown In Trodmore 2020</tt> is not. When you've entered the name,
    click <em>Create Tourney</em>.
    When that succeeds, click the "click here to continue" link
    and you will land on the Tourney Setup page.
    </p>
    <h2>The Tourney Setup page</h2>
    <p>
    The Tourney Setup page allows you to load the list of players and
    specify the rules of the tournament.
    To get back to this page at any time, you can click the
    <em>General Setup</em> link in the sidebar.
    </p>
    <h3>First, enter the player names</h3>
    <p>
    A tourney isn't much of a tourney without players. The text area under
    the heading <em>Player List</em> is where your list of players
    goes. Put each player name on a separate line, starting with the
    highest-rated player and finishing with the lowest-rated player. If
    your tournament is split into divisions, put a hyphen (-) on a line
    by itself to indicate where the splits are.
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't worry if the number of players isn't an exact multiple of your
    desired group size (usually 2 or 3). The fixture generators will
    automatically generate games against Prune if required. In earlier versions
    of Atropine the user had to add Prunes manually with a rating of 0, but as
    of 1.2.1 this is no longer required.
    </p>
    <p>
    Here's an example list of players you can copy and paste into the player
    list box.
    </p>
    <pre>    Cymbelina Spatchcock
    Lord Hoppleton
    Compton Pauncefoot
    Vampira Smithersby
    Tinned Peaches
    Infumbula Trousers
    Jacquard Hookflash
    Trilby Battenberg
    Blancmange McTaggart
    Sincerity Sandwich
    Salzburg Pound-Quedgeley</pre>
    <p>
    Then click <em>Save Player List</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Now deal with the other stuff</h3>
    <p>
    The General Setup stage is also where you can specify other
    attributes like how many rounds are expected (so it can automatically
    work out if someone's qualified for the final) and which tables are
    the designated Acccessible Tables, if any.
    </p>
    <h3>Accessible Tables</h3>
    <p>
    You may want to ensure that certain players are always assigned to a
    specific table number (or one of a set of numbers) if possible. Usually
    this is to take account of accessibility requirements for wheelchair users
    at the venue. Atropine provides a mechanism to help with this. The
    decisions made by fixture generators of who plays whom are <em>not</em>
    affected by these accessibility requirements - the only thing affected is
    which table number the player and their opponents are assigned to.
    </p>
    <h4>Tell Atropine which are the accessible tables</h4>
    <p>
    In the <em>Accessibility</em> section of the General Setup page
    you can define which are the "accessible" tables by putting a list of
    table numbers in the box, separated by commas.
    </p>
    <h4>Tell Atropine which players require accessible tables</h4>
    <p>
    On the setup page for a player, you can tick a box to mark them as
    requiring an accessible table. You can reach this page using the
    <em>Players...</em> link in the sidebar under General Setup. Click the name
    of the player, tick the <em>Requires accessible table</em> box, and
    Save Changes. You can also set a "preferred table number" for that player
    if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
    Players who require an accessible table will be placed on one if possible.
    Once again, accessibility requirements will not affect who plays whom, only
    the number of the table that player and their opponents play on.
    </p>
    <p>
    If there are more players than accessible tables, the fixture generator
    page will warn you.
    </p>
