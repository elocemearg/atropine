    <h1>Broadcast setup</h1>
    <p>
    Atropine is designed to work without any internet access - everything is
    hosted on your own computer. This has been a design goal from the very
    beginning. The Broadcast feature, however, is the one thing that breaks
    this rule. Access to <tt>greem.co.uk</tt> from the computer running
    Atropine is required to use this feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Yes, you need a username and password</h2>
    <p>If you have a username and password at
    <a href="https://greem.co.uk/coliveadmin" target="_blank">https://greem.co.uk/coliveadmin</a>
	you can make live updates from your tournament appear at the URL
    <tt>https://greem.co.uk/co/your_tournament_name</tt>. You can't sign up for
	an account yourself; I have to create one for you.
    </p>

    <h2>The Broadcast Setup page</h2>
    <p>
    Click the <em>Broadcast Setup</em> link in the sidebar. Fill in your
    username and password and click <em>Start Broadcasting</em>. Once this is
    done, Atropine will upload the state of your tourney to the server every
    ten seconds. It will continue doing this until you tell it to stop
    (<em>Stop Broadcasting</em>), or until you close Atropine.
    </p>

    <h2>Tourney names must be globally unique</h2>
    <p>
    The server won't allow two tourneys with the same name. So if you
    called last year's tourney <tt>colin</tt>, and uploaded it to the website,
    then if you call this year's tourney <tt>colin</tt> and try to upload it
    you'll get an error. You'll either have to call the tourney something else
    or manually delete the original tourney from the website.
    </p>

    <h2>Broadcast status widget in the sidebar</h2>
    <p>
    While you're administering the rest of the tourney, the status of the
    uploads will be shown in the sidebar underneath the <em>Broadcast
    Setup</em> link. A horizontal traffic light image tells you how it's
    getting on.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <li>If all three lights are off, the Broadcast feature is off. Nothing
            is being uploaded. This is the default.</li>
        <li>If the red light is flashing, it means the last upload was rejected
            by the server. This could be because your username or password was
            incorrect, for example.</li>
        <li>If the red and amber light are both flashing, it means the last
            upload couldn't reach the server. This usually indicates some
            problem with your internet connection, or possibly a problem with
            the server.</li>
        <li>If the amber light is flashing, it means it doesn't have any
            information yet about whether the last upload succeeded. Wait a
            few seconds.</li>
        <li>If the green light is on, then the last upload was successful.</li>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
    If the last upload was not successful, a duration is indicated next to the
    traffic light (e.g. <tt>5m</tt>). This is how long the problem has lasted.
    In other words, <tt>5m</tt> means Atropine hasn't done a successful upload
    of the tourney state for at least five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the last upload was successful, then next to the traffic light is an
    eye symbol and a number, on a green background. This is the number of
    people currently viewing this tourney's page on the website.
