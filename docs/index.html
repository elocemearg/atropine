	<h1>Atropine Tutorial</h1>

	<p>
	Atropine is a Countdown tournament administration system controlled
	by your web browser. Teleost is a program that continually reads the
	state of the tournament and updates a window showing standings, results
	and other information.
	</p>

	<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>
	The two things you need that might not be installed on your computer
	already are <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and
	<a href="http://pygame.org">pygame</a>. Python is the programming
	language in which Atropine and Teleost are written. pygame is a module
	for Python which, among other things, gives graphical capabilities to
	a Python application.
	</p>
	<p>
	To use Atropine, you need
	<a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python 2.x</a> installed.
	At the time of writing, the latest version of this is
	<a href="http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/">2.7.6</a>.
	If you are using Windows, you want the "Windows x86 MSI Installer".
	</p>
	<p>
	To use Teleost, which is the program that displays standings and
	results on the screen, you need <a href="http://pygame.org">pygame</a>
	in addition to Python. Go to the
	<a href="http://pygame.org/download.shtml">pygame download page</a>
	and download and install the version of pygame compatible with your
	Python installation. At the time of writing, the latest version of
	pygame is 1.9.1, and <a href="http://pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi">pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.7.msi</a>
	is the Windows installer for the specific pygame version compatible
	with Python 2.7.
	</p>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>
	After you have installed the prerequisites detailed above, unzip
	atropine.zip into a directory of your choosing. There are a number
	of files and directories, but the only ones you need to know about
	to use Atropine and Teleost are <tt>atropine.py</tt> and
	<tt>teleost.py</tt>.
	</p>
	<h2>Starting Atropine</h2>
	<p>
	Atropine is a web server. When you run it, you leave it sitting in the
	background and then use your web browser to connect to it and
	administer tournaments. To start atropine, run
	<tt>atropine.py</tt>. The Windows Firewall might tell you
	it has blocked some features of Python and ask you what you want to
	do about it. You need to allow Python to use at least private networks.
	</p>
	<p>
	Once <tt>atropine.py</tt> is running, use your web browser to
	visit <a href="http://localhost:3960/">http://localhost:3960</a>. This
	will redirect you to the home screen.
	</p>
	<h2>Creating a tourney</h2>
	<p>
	Decide on a name for your tourney and enter it into the "Tourney name"
	box. This name must consist only of letters, numbers, underscores and
	hyphens - no spaces. So "colin2014" is okay, but "Countdown In Lincoln
	2014" is not. Then click <em>Create Tourney</em>.
	When that succeeds, click the "click here to continue" link
	and you will land on the Tourney Setup page.
	</p>
	<h2>Starting Teleost (optional)</h2>
	<p>
	If you want to show everyone the standings and results, you'll use
	Teleost for this. This step isn't necessary to administer a tournament,
	but if you want to use Teleost then just run <tt>teleost.py</tt> and
	enter the name of your tournament when prompted. The Teleost window
	should then appear. Once it's running and you've got the window
	positioned where you want it, it shouldn't need any more
	intervention.
	</p>
	<h2>Tourney Setup</h2>
	<p>
	The Tourney Setup page allows you to load the list of players and
	specify the rules of the tournament.
	To get back to this page at any time, you can click the
	<em>Setup</em> link in the sidebar.
	</p>
	<p>
	A tourney isn't much of a tourney without players. The text area under
	the heading <em>Player List</em> is where your list of players
	goes. Put each player name on a separate line, starting with the
	highest-rated player and finishing with the lowest-rated player. The
	reason this is one big text box rather than many little text boxes, one
	for each player, is to make it easier to copy and paste the list of
	players from somewhere else.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each player is assigned a rating. If you want to assign a rating to
	a player, follow their name with a comma and the rating, like this:
	</p>
	<pre>	Kevin Birks,1850</pre>
	<p>
	If any players are not given ratings, ratings are automatically
	assigned to players with the top player receiving a rating of 2000,
	the second player 1980, the next player 1960, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
	<em>N.B.</em> If you need to add a patzer player (an Apterous
	Prune) to take the number of players up to a multiple of two or three,
	give them a rating of zero.
	</p>
	<p>
	Copy and paste the following example players into the player list box.
	</p>
	<pre>	Kevin Birks
	Jonathan Rawlplug
	Dark Meeks
	Giles Huc-Things
	Ed McBellface
	Admiral Glad
	Jack Worzel
	Some Hurst
	Some Other Hurst
	Randy Prat
	David B Barnyard
	Apterous Prune,0</pre>
	<p>
	Then click <em>Save Player List</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Tourney Setup stage is also where you can specify how many players
	are on a table, and how to rank players, but leave those as the
	defaults for now.
	</p>
	<h2>Generating Fixtures</h2>
	<p>
	Once your tourney has some players, you can get on with generating
	fixtures for the first round. This tutorial will assume a COLIN-style
	tournament structure: there are three rounds, in each round
	players are divided into groups of three, and in each group three
	games are played, with each player playing two games and hosting one.
	</p>
	<p>
	Click the <em>Generate new round...</em> link in the sidebar.
	You'll be presented with a list of fixture generators. Click
	<em>COLIN Fixture Generator</em>. For the first round, this
	will come back to you with a list of fixtures immediately.
	</p>
	<p>
	Review the fixtures, then click <em>Accept Fixtures</em>. The
	fixtures aren't committed until you click this button.
	</p>
	<p>
	You should then see a page telling you the fixtures were added
	successfully. Click the <em>View games</em> link to go to the
	score editor.
	</p>

	<h2>Filling in scores</h2>
	<p>
	The score editor is the page you'll be using the most. There is one for
	every round, and you can get to the score editor for a particular round
	by clicking the link with that round's name in the sidebar, e.g.
	"Round 1".
	</p>
	<p>
	When a game is finished and you have the score, type it in the
	corresponding box and click <em>Save</em> or press ENTER.
	</p>
	<p>
	Normally a score is two numbers separated by a hyphen, e.g. 56-52, but
	the score editor is pretty permissive with what it will accept as a
	score. As long as it looks like a number, followed by something that
	isn't a number, followed by another number, it'll accept it. If you
	enter something it doesn't understand, a suitable admonishment will
	appear in the "Remarks" column for that game.
	</p>
	<p>
	If a game was won on a tiebreak, include an asterisk (*) in the score.
	This can go anywhere in the score text apart from in the middle of a
	number. Points scored on tiebreaks do not count towards a player's
	total.
	</p>
	<p>
	Remember to click <em>Save</em> (or press ENTER) after entering
	a result. If you change a score box and don't save it, its background
	will turn yellow to warn you that it hasn't been saved. Scores are not
	written to the database until you save them. If you try to navigate
	away from the page when there are unsaved results, a box will appear
	warning you that you're about to lose work.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you've got Teleost open, you'll find that when you enter the first
	result the display switches to showing the standings table and a
	scrolling window for the latest results.
	</p>
	<h2>The rest of the tourney</h2>
	<p>
	When you've entered all results for one round and you're ready to
	generate fixtures for the next round, click
	<em>Generate new round...</em> as before. This time, if you
	click <em>COLIN Fixture Generator</em> you'll be asked a
	question before proceeding. The COLIN fixture generator needs to
	group together players with similar performance, ensuring players don't
	play anyone they've already played in the tourney. This is rather
	complicated, so you can specify a time limit after which it will give
	you the best grouping it has found up to that point. The default is
	15 seconds.
	</p>
	<p>
	Therefore, when you click the <em>Generate Fixtures</em> button
	for round 2 onwards, it may take a few seconds to bring you the
	fixtures. With our example of 12 players it should be very quick, but
	in larger tournaments the fixtures will take longer to generate.
	</p>
	<h2>Display Control</h2>
	<p>
	The <em>Display Control</em> link in the sidebar takes you to
	a menu asking which screen you want Teleost to show. It does no harm to
	leave it on the default setting "Auto", but if you want the Teleost
	window to show a particular screen, you can select it and click
	<em>Apply Settings</em>. Teleost will then show only that
	screen until you specify otherwise.
	</p>
	<p>
	In <em>Auto</em> mode, Teleost uses the following rules to
	decide which screen to show:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the tourney is in a knockout stage, Teleost displays
		the <em>Fixtures</em> screen.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, if the latest round has had fixtures generated
		but no scores have been filled in yet, Teleost displays the
		<em>Fixtures</em> screen.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, if the latest round has had some but not all of
		its scores filled in, Teleost displays the
		<em>Standings / Videprinter</em> screen.</li>
		<li>If in the latest round all games have had their
		scores filled in, Teleost displays the
		<em>Standings / Table Results</em> screen.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	In <em>Auto</em> mode, Teleost never shows the
	<em>Records</em> or <em>Overachievers</em> screens,
	so if you want to show those you need to switch to them manually using
	the Display Control menu.
