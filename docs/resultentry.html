    <h1>Entering results</h1>
    <p>
    This is the page you'll be using the most. After you generate fixtures
    you'll be led to the Results Entry page. You can also get there using the
    "Results entry" link in the sidebar.
    </p>

    <h2>Result entry controls</h2>
    <p>
    As of atropine 0.8.0, the results entry interface gives you a box to
    enter results at the top of the screen ("Result entry"), then a
    videprinter-like display of recently-entered results below that ("News
    feed"), then a box of blinkenlights.
    </p>

    <h3>Result entry</h3>
    <p>
    When you want to enter a result, first enter the players' names in the
    player name boxes, then enter the players' scores in the boxes below, then
    press enter or click <em>Submit result</em>. As you type a player's name,
    it will be auto-completed for you when you've typed enough. You can press
    TAB to move on to the next box.
    </p>
    <p>
    It doesn't matter which way round the two players appear on the fixture
    list - you can enter either name first. It is recommended that if you're
    handed a scoresheet with a result on it, you enter the names in the order
    they appear on the scoresheet. It's easier and avoids mistakes.
    </p>
    <h4>Tiebreaks</h4>
    <p>
    If the score you enter has a winning margin of exactly 10, a checkbox will
    appear asking you whether this game was won on a tiebreak conundrum. Tick
    the box if so. This will cause the winner's extra 10 points for the
    tiebreak not to be counted in the standings table. If you're used to the
    old interface, typing an asterisk (*) next to the score in one of the score
    boxes is another way of indicating that a game was won on a tiebreak.
    </p>
    <h4>Double loss</h4>
    <p>
    If you want to record a game as having been lost by both players, enter a
    score of 0-0 and tick the tiebreak box, which will now have become the
    "loss for both players" box. This causes the game to be a 0-0 loss on
    both sides. Neither player is credited with any points for the game and
    it is not counted as a draw. This is useful if neither player turns up to
    play their game.
    </p>

    <h3>Recent results / news feed</h3>
    <p>
    This is the videprinter-like display on the Results Entry page. It shows
    all the results so far entered for this round. If you want to correct a
    result, click it in the videprinter and the details will be loaded into the
    result entry form. Correct the score and submit it. Corrected entries
    appear grey with a line through them.
    </p>
    <p>
    As of version 1.1.0, you can also add news items containing arbitrary text.
    These will appear on the videprinter on the public display, but the line
    won't wrap if it's too long, so try to be brief. These news items will also
    appear on the live updates webpage if you're using that feature
    (see <a href="broadcastsetup.html">Broadcast Setup</a>).
    </p>

    <h3>Blinkenlights</h3>
    <p>
    The Blinkenlights are a grid of numbered boxes. Each box represents a
    table, or board, on which one or more games are being played in that round.
    Within each numbered box is one coloured box for each game being played on
    that table. A grey box means the result for that game has been entered, and
    a red box means we don't have the result yet.
    </p>
    <p>
    The purpose of the Blinkenlights is to show you at a glance which tables
    have had their results entered and which haven't. At a Lincoln-style event
    this can be useful to identify which tables are playing slowly or hoarding
    their scoresheets.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you hover the mouse cursor over a table number, the message bar at the
    bottom of the Blinkenlights shows you the list of players on that table.
    If you hover over a red or grey box representing a game, it shows you the
    players playing in that game, and the score if applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can click a red or grey box to load that game's details into the
    results entry interface, for results input or correction. If you'd rather
    the names and scores were loaded into the results entry interface the other
    way round, click the same game again and they'll swap over.
    </p>
    <h3>Historical note: I hate this new interface! I want the old interface back, the one with the list of games!</h3>
    <p>
    The old interface from pre-0.8.0 editions of Atropine is still there, but I
    strongly recommend trying out the new interface if you can. The main reason
    for this is that with the old interface, it was very, very easy to
    accidentally enter the result for a game the wrong way round and not notice.
    This usually happened when the score editor showed, say, "Alice v Bob" and
    the scoresheet handed to the organiser had the names the other way
    round, "Bob 34-56 Alice". If you've entered 200 results already that
    day, it's very likely you'll accidentally type in "34-56" for Alice v Bob
    instead of the correct "56-34".
    </p>
    <p>
    Nevertheless, if you need to use the old interface, which showed you all
    the games in a list with an edit box for each one, it's still there: just
    click the <em>"show all the games in this round as a list"</em> link at the
    bottom of the results entry page.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are some very rare cases where you might need the old interface. If
    you've generated a round in which two players play each other twice (this
    used to be possible with some fixture generators), only the old interface
    will work for those matches. Also, the old interface allowed you to declare
    that a match was won on a tiebreak when the winning margin was something
    other than 10. Arguably this was a bug, but if you ever need to do that
    because some event has weird rules, then you need to use the old interface
    to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
    Aside from that, you should be using the new interface. If there's any
    problem with the new interface that's driving you back to the old one,
    let me know, and I'll look at making appropriate improvements to the new
    interface.
    </p>
    <h2>After the round is over</h2>
    <p>
    When you've entered all results for one round and you're ready to generate
    fixtures for the next round, click <em>Generate Fixtures...</em> as before,
    and generate the fixtures for the next round as explained in the
    <a href="fixtures.html">Generating Fixtures</a> help page.
