        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

    <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
    <p>
    There is only one thing you need to have installed that you might not have
    already, and that is <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.
    Python is the programming language in which Atropine is written.
    </p>
    <p>
    To use Atropine, you need
    <a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> installed.
    At the time of writing (October 2019), the latest version of this is 3.8.0.
    If there's a newer version by the time you read this, then install that.
    </p>
    <p>
    Historical note:
    Earlier versions of Atropine needed the Python module "pygame" for the
    public-facing screen. pygame is no longer needed. If you already have it
    installed then you don't need to remove it, but you don't need it.
    </p>
    <h3>Python 3</h3>
    <p>
    Older versions of atropine used Python 2. Starting from version 1.0.0,
    all atropine releases will be for Python 3, and only for Python 3. The
    rest of this help will assume you are using Python 3.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
    After you have installed Python 3 as above, unzip <tt>atropine.zip</tt>
    into a folder of your choosing. There are a number of files and folders,
    but the only one you need to know about to use Atropine is
    <tt>atropine.py</tt>.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting Atropine</h2>
    <p>
    Atropine is a web server. When you run it, you leave it sitting in the
    background and then use your web browser to connect to it and
    administer tournaments. To start atropine, run
    <tt>atropine.py</tt>. The Windows Firewall might tell you
    it has blocked some features of Python and ask you what you want to
    do about it. You need to allow Python to use at least private networks.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once <tt>atropine.py</tt> is running, use your web browser to
    visit <a href="http://localhost:3960/">http://localhost:3960</a>. This
    will redirect you to the home screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Next step</h2>
    <p>
    Once you've got Atropine running, you can <a href="tourneysetup.html">set
        up your first tourney</a>.
