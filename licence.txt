Atropine was developed as a way to administer a Countdown tournament using a
web browser. Later it was adapted to support some of the features of Scrabble
tournaments.

Teleost is a pygame-based program intended to run on a separate screen, which
monitors a tournament database managed by atropine and displays information
to players.
